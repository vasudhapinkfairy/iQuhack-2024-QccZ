Our group "Qccz" has come up with the following algorithms that can implement the CZ gate and the CCZ gate.
The goal is to write the Unitary matrix of the transformation gate. Our approach was to write the 
From Ref[5] of the problem set, we came up with the formalism to get the "alpha" values while writing the transformation matrix of the CZ gate. 

CZ gate:
